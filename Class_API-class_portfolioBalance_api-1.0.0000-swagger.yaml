  title: PBS - Portfolio Balance Service API
  version: 1.0.0000
  description: | 
   The Portfolio Balance Service (PBS) aims to facilitate the activation, authorization, and collection of client financial data from mutually agreed financial institutions. 
   This API service provides the holding balances and market values of entities to offer a single view of wealth. This information could be used to integrate with CRM systems or dashboards.
   
   In order to use the PBS API, you will need to obtain:
   - 1 OAuth credentials 
   - 2 Access token, using your OAuth credentials. 
   
   Authorization servers:
   PIE (Sandbox): https://demo-apps.hub24.com.au/Hub24_OAuth/rest/oauth2/token
   Production: https://apps.hub24.com.au/Hub24_OAuth/rest/oauth2/token 
   
   Obtain an access token by making a call to the authorization server as follows: 
   
   --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
   --data 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={your client id}&client_secret={your client secret}'

   You will receive a response providing: 
    - your Access token of type "Bearer" (valid for 24 hours)
    - your Refresh token
  
   Once you have an Access token, then call the API resource server as follows:
   
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer ae2ef02cd882530c545d238c771dc15af7b8148ef5bd5d38b7b3ad1346c4'
   
   Authorization value should use the word "Bearer" followed by a space and then the {Access token} obtained earlier.  
   Results will be paged, so ensure you request and obtain paging metadata to ensure you retrieve all information.
